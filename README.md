# Meteorite-Landing

Meteorite, any fairly small natural object from interplanetary space i.e., a meteoroid that survives its passage through Earthâ€™s atmosphere and lands on the surface. Many meteorites fall on earth surface every year which differs in mass, composition and location. There are many data whose Year is not given. This is a project that uses Python and NASA data to guess year of landing on the basis of coordinates of the meteorites.

Approach : Regression Algorithm

Dataset collected from NASA's Data Portal.

The Meteorite Landings dataset contains location, mass, and composition data on over 45k meteorites that have landed on Earth.

#### To start the program, first install required libs:

<ol>
<li>pip install numpy</li>
<li>pip install pandas</li>
</ol>

#### Now, you are ready to run. Run " python3 meteorite_landing.py " in terminal in linux or " python meteorite_landing.py " in command prompt in windows.
